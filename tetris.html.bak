  <h1>Evolution of Tetris</h1>
  <h2>History of Tetris</h2>
  <p>The history of Tetris scales back all the way to 1984, where a Russin scientist named Alexey Pajitnov developed the very first Tetris that most of all know. In 1988, Video game designer and publisher Henk Rogers discovers Tetris at a Las Vegas tradeshow and is instantly hooked on the game. Soon after, Henk's company, Bullet-Proof Software, releases Tetris on the PC and NES in Japan. It becomes a "software blockbuster," selling over two million copies.</p>
